AirBnB clone
============

The AriBnB clone project is a simple copy of the Airbnb website that implement features which covers all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track. It is composed by:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## The command interpreter

( It will be descripe soon )
